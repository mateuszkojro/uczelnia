    I am writing ti apply for position of a junior software developer which appeared in the pracuj.pl list of offers.
    I graduated in 2019. I completed a 3 month Google scholarship in writing Android applications. I am graduate of Mat-Fiz-Inf class from 3LO in Bydgoszcz. I believe that the education I got there in addition to my experience gained in my personal projects will provide me with good knowledge of software developers responsibilities. In November I will start my second year of bachelors degree in science at University of Łódź
My studies equipped me with lot of theoretical knowledge but I unfortunately I have no practical experience in the field.
    I am hard working and willing to learn. I have good interpersonal skills.I fluently speak English and know basics of Deutsch. I am familiar with Android Studio and Java programing language.
    I always wanted to work for a firm that focuses on rapid development and uses the most recent frameworks.
    I will be available for an interview at any time convenient to you. In the attachment I enclose my CV.
Yours faithfully
Mateusz Kojro
